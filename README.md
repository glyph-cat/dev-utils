# Introduction
* This package is meant for library authors.
* This package comes with several basic helpers for showing logs and errors in development environments.
* This package is meant to be included in the code bundle. Please **do not** specify this as an external dependency. Although this will result in a slightly larger code bundle, but...
* This package reallyÂ² light. Still, it is encouraged to use ES6 style imports and exports to take advantage of tree shaking to further reduce the final code bundle size.
